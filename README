Changelog:

- Just added some Eclipse Indigo dependencies constraints in plug-ins manifests, so as to provide an Eclipse indigo compatibility.

TODO:

- plug-in org.parallelj.designer.properties actually uses an old version of the EEF Api. We need to rewrite it using the actual API.




ParallelJ-Studio is a part of the ParallelJ project corresponding to the Eclipse plug-ins part. 
It contains the graphical editor, but also the code generator and the ParallelJ metamodel.
